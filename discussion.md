Between crafted-experience and crafted-experiences, I’d recommend crafted-experiences ✅
Here’s why:
·   	crafted-experience (singular) feels like it refers to just one type of experience, which might limit the perception of your agency’s offerings.
·   	crafted-experiences (plural) suggests a collection of tailored journeys and events, aligning better with what a travel and event agency does. It gives the impression of diversity, personalization, and multiple possibilities.
👉 Extra tips:
·   	You could also consider dropping the dash for smoother branding: Crafted Experiences. It looks more premium and is easier to read.
·   	If you want a more distinctive identity, you might explore slight variations like The Crafted Experience(s), Crafted Journeys, or Crafted Moments.
Would you like me to brainstorm some alternative premium-sounding names in the same spirit, in case you want more options before deciding?

 
Great question — because the name will need to work across corporate (formal, B2B, events, incentives) and leisure (holidays, retreats, lifestyle) markets.
Here’s how Crafted Experiences (or Crafted-Experiences) performs across both:
✅ Corporate
·   	The word “crafted” conveys precision, tailoring, and professionalism — qualities corporates value in event management and incentive travel.
·   	“Experiences” resonates well with MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) and CSR events, since companies now seek unique “experience-driven” activities for employees and clients.
✅ Leisure
·   	“Crafted” speaks to personalization and authenticity, which leisure travelers are looking for (they don’t want generic packages).
·   	“Experiences” is aspirational, suggesting memories and journeys beyond just a hotel stay.
⚖️ The only consideration:
·   	Corporate clients may sometimes prefer slightly more neutral, “serious” branding. If you stick with Crafted Experiences, you can balance this by adjusting your visual identity (sleek, minimalist logo and formal tone in corporate comms) vs. a warmer, lifestyle-driven aesthetic for leisure.
👉 In short: Crafted Experiences is flexible and premium enough to cover both segments.
Would you like me to show you how the same brand name could be positioned differently for corporate vs. leisure (slogans, messaging angles, and tone)?

 
Here’s what I found about Namecheap’s email offerings when you buy a domain — what’s included, what costs extra, and how many addresses you can get:

✅ What is included with a Namecheap domain
Email forwarding (free): With any domain registration, Namecheap gives you free email forwarding. That means you can create custom addresses like info@yourdomain.com and have all incoming mail forwarded to an existing email account (e.g. Gmail). (EliChoice)
Private Email (paid): To get full mailboxes (send + receive from the domain, storage, webmail etc.), you generally need to purchase their Private Email service. (makersaid.com)

⚠️ What’s not included (or has limitations)
Buying a domain does not automatically give you a full email hosting service. If you want inboxes you can send from and manage, you’ll need to pay for Private Email or host via a web hosting plan. (EliChoice)
Free forwarding addresses are limited in how they work (for example: forwarding only, no mailbox storage). (Truehost)

➕ How many email addresses forwarding you can have
Namecheap allows up to 100 email forwarders per domain. That means you could have up to 100 different “alias” addresses forwarding into your real mailbox. (Reddit)
If using Private Email or a hosting plan, the number of inbox/mailboxes depends on the plan you choose. The cheaper plans have fewer mailboxes; more expensive plans allow more. (Exact number depends on current pricing/tier.) (makersaid.com)

If you like, I can check the latest Private Email plan tiers for Namecheap and see how many real mailboxes (send + receive) come with each, so you can pick one that works for both corporate & leisure needs.

 
That’s a very strategic question — and you’re right to pause here, because how you structure your brand and website will shape how clients perceive you. Let me break it down for you:

1. One brand (Crafted Experiences) for both travel & events
✅ Pros
·   	Stronger brand equity: all your effort goes into building and promoting one name.
·   	Cross-selling is easier: a corporate client who hires you for an incentive trip may later trust you with their gala dinner or event.
·   	The name Crafted Experiences is broad and premium enough to cover both segments without sounding limiting.
⚠️ Cons
·   	If the website isn’t structured clearly, corporate clients might feel distracted by leisure content, and leisure travelers might feel overwhelmed by corporate jargon.
👉 Solution if you keep one brand:
·   	Build one website with a clear split in navigation (e.g. For Corporates | For Leisure).
·   	Tailor the content style: more formal and ROI-focused for corporates; more emotional and lifestyle-driven for leisure.
·   	This way, you “house” everything under Crafted Experiences but avoid confusion.

2. Two brands (Crafted Experiences for leisure & EVENTI for events)
✅ Pros
·   	Sharper positioning: EVENTI feels like a pure corporate events brand — very clear for B2B.
·   	Each website can speak entirely in its own language without compromise.
·   	Prevents brand dilution: clients know exactly what you’re about from the first second.
⚠️ Cons
·   	You’ll need to double your marketing effort (two websites, two social strategies, two SEO builds, two reputations to maintain).
·   	May confuse existing clients: “Are they two separate companies? Do they belong together?”
·   	Splits your brand equity instead of concentrating it.

3. Hybrid option (best of both worlds)
·   	Keep Crafted Experiences as the master brand (umbrella).
·   	Use EVENTI as a sub-brand dedicated to corporate events, powered by Crafted Experiences.
o   Example: EVENTI by Crafted Experiences.
·   	On your website: one main brand (Crafted Experiences) → homepage clearly routes visitors:
o   “Corporate Experiences” (EVENTI)
o   “Leisure Journeys”
This keeps your branding consistent, builds trust, and gives corporate clients a polished, focused space without losing the lifestyle side.

✨ My recommendation for your case:
Since you told me your main segment is corporate groups (both for travel and events), I’d suggest sticking with Crafted Experiences as your main brand. EVENTI can work as a division/sub-brand under it, but I wouldn’t split into two entirely separate brands/websites — it will fragment your energy and slow down growth.

Would you like me to sketch a website structure (menu/navigation) that would let you serve both segments clearly under one Crafted Experiences site, while giving EVENTI a strong spotlight for corporates?

 
Perfect — here’s a website structure that keeps everything under Crafted Experiences, while giving a strong, distinct space for your corporate/event segment (EVENTI).

🌐 Website Structure for Crafted Experiences
1. Homepage
·   	Hero section: premium visuals (travel + events blend).
·   	Clear dual call-to-action:
o   For Corporates (EVENTI)
o   For Leisure Travelers
·   	Tagline suggestion:
“Crafted Experiences – Tailored journeys & events for every moment that matters.”

2. For Corporates – EVENTI
(You can use the name EVENTI by Crafted Experiences)
·   	Corporate Travel Solutions
o   Incentive trips
o   Team-building retreats

8. Contact
·   	Separate forms for Corporate Inquiries (EVENTI) vs. Leisure Requests.

·   	Use two distinct color accents to guide users:
o   A sleek, professional color (navy, charcoal, or gold) for EVENTI (corporate).
o   A warmer, lifestyle color (emerald, terracotta, or teal) for Leisure.
·   	This creates a visual split without needing two different websites.

👉 This structure lets you:
·   	Keep Crafted Experiences as your umbrella brand.
·   	Give EVENTI visibility as a premium corporate/events division.
·   	Avoid confusing clients while strengthening your credibility in both markets.

Do you want me to also draft homepage messaging (hero headline + two CTA blocks for corporate vs leisure) so you can directly plug it into your website design?

About Us (Crafted Experiences + EVENTI)
(placeholder draft — later we’ll integrate your personal founder story)
At Crafted Experiences, we are more than a travel and event agency — we are storytellers, designers, and connectors. With a passion for excellence and a global network of trusted partners, we transform ideas into seamless experiences.
Our philosophy rests on three pillars:
·   	Connections: A trusted network of global and local partners.
·   	Craftsmanship: Tailoring every detail with precision and creativity.
·   	Character: Building experiences that carry meaning and leave a legacy.
With EVENTI by Crafted Experiences, we extend this promise to the corporate world — offering companies hassle-free, trend-driven solutions for travel and events that inspire, motivate, and deliver measurable impact.

✨ This gives you:
·   	A strong corporate narrative for EVENTI (hassle-free, partner network, industry-leading).
·   	An aspirational tone for leisure (personalized, memorable, authentic).
·   	A unified umbrella brand voice that is premium and consistent.

Would you like me to also propose the tone of voice guidelines (word choice, style, formality) so that both your corporate (EVENTI) and leisure messaging stay consistent but still speak to their specific audiences?
Excellent — having tone of voice guidelines will make your brand communication consistent across website, emails, proposals, and social media. Since you’re serving two audiences (corporates vs. leisure), the tone needs to be coherent but adaptable.
Here’s a framework you can use for Crafted Experiences and EVENTI:

🎤 Tone of Voice Guidelines
1. Brand Voice (Umbrella – Crafted Experiences)
Overall personality:
·   	Premium yet approachable – warm but not casual.
·   	Tailored & detail-oriented – highlighting craftsmanship.
·   	Aspirational – speaks to emotions, memories, and value.
Key traits:
·   	Confident, not arrogant (“We deliver seamless solutions” vs. “We are the only experts”).
·   	Inspirational, not fluffy (focus on tangible impact and stories).
·   	Polished, not stiff (professional but human).

2. Corporate Voice (EVENTI)
🎯 Target Audience: Corporate decision-makers (HR directors, marketing managers, CEOs). They want ROI, hassle-free execution, and innovation.
Tone:
·   	Professional & solution-driven
·   	Clear and concise – minimal fluff, direct benefits.
·   	Trust-building – emphasize your partner network, reliability, and results.
Language examples:
·   	Instead of: “We create unforgettable moments.”
·   	Use: “We design corporate events that inspire teams, engage clients, and deliver measurable impact.”
Vocabulary:
·   	Efficiency, seamless, innovative, measurable, impact, trusted partners, trend-driven, hassle-free, ROI.
Style:
·   	Shorter sentences, clarity first.
·   	Use bullet points when listing services (makes it easier for corporates to scan).

3. Leisure Voice (Crafted Experiences – Travel)
🌍 Target Audience: Individual travelers, couples, families seeking authenticity, personalization, and memorable journeys.
Tone:
·   	Inspirational & emotive – paint a picture of the experience.
·   	Personalized – “your journey,” “your story.”
·   	Storytelling – describe places and feelings, not just logistics.
Language examples:
·   	Instead of: “We organize trips to Tunisia and abroad.”
·   	Use: “From the hidden medinas of Tunis to the shores of the Mediterranean, we craft journeys that feel like they were designed just for you.”
Vocabulary:
·   	Tailored, unforgettable, immersive, curated, authentic, inspiring, story, memory, journey.
Style:
·   	Longer, more descriptive sentences.
·   	Evocative language, sensory words.

4. Shared Elements (Consistency Across Both)
No matter the audience, always:
·   	Use active voice (“We create” vs. “It is created”).
·   	Focus on the benefit to the client (“We take care of every detail so you can focus on what matters”).
·   	Keep a premium and elegant feel — no slang, no overly casual tone.

✨ Example Side-by-Side
EVENTI (Corporate):
“EVENTI by Crafted Experiences provides end-to-end solutions for corporate travel and events. Through our network of trusted partners, we deliver seamless, hassle-free experiences that motivate teams, impress clients, and support your business goals.”
Crafted Experiences (Leisure):
“At Crafted Experiences, every journey is a story waiting to be told. Whether it’s a luxury escape, a cultural immersion, or a family adventure, we design moments that stay with you long after you return.”

👉 With this dual-tone framework, your umbrella brand stays consistent, but your corporate and leisure audiences feel like you’re speaking directly to them.

Would you like me to also design a brand tagline architecture (one master tagline + tailored taglines for EVENTI and Leisure), so your messaging feels unified but adaptable across touchpoints?

 
Perfect — this will give you a brand tagline architecture (one umbrella tagline + sub-taglines) and a mini design guideline (brand book outline) you can hand to your web designer/developer. It will help ensure your website and materials feel coherent and premium.

🎯 Brand Tagline Architecture
Umbrella Brand – Crafted Experiences
·   	Master Tagline:
“Crafting Moments, Designing Memories.”
Corporate Division – EVENTI by Crafted Experiences
·   	Sub-Tagline Options (choose depending on context):
1. 	“Professional Events. Hassle-Free Solutions.”
2. 	“Where Business Meets Inspiration.”
3. 	“Turning Business Goals into Memorable Experiences.”
Leisure Division – Crafted Experiences (Travel)
·   	Sub-Tagline Options (choose depending on context):
1. 	“Journeys as Unique as You Are.”
2. 	“Travel Designed Around Your Story.”
3. 	“From Destinations to Memories.”
👉 This structure lets you always anchor communication in the Crafted Experiences umbrella, while fine-tuning the tagline for the audience.

🎨 Brand Design Guideline (Outline)
This is what you can prepare as a mini brand book for your web designer:

1. Logo Usage
·   	Main Logo: Crafted Experiences (premium typography, simple & elegant).
·   	Sub-Brand Lockup: EVENTI by Crafted Experiences (smaller “by Crafted Experiences” under EVENTI).
·   	Logo Variants: Full color, black, white (for flexible use on backgrounds).
·   	Clear Space: Leave padding equal to the “C” height around the logo.
·   	Don’ts: Don’t stretch, skew, or use unapproved colors.

2. Color Palette
·   	Primary Colors:
o   Deep Navy (#1C1F36) – corporate trust & premium feel.
o   Elegant Gold (#C7A464) – sophistication & luxury.
·   	Secondary Colors:
o   Emerald Green (#0F6B4E) – for leisure/nature & aspirational travel.
o   Warm Terracotta (#B55239) – for cultural & lifestyle warmth.
·   	Neutrals:
o   Light Sand (#F5F3EF) – clean background.
o   Charcoal Gray (#3A3A3A) – text.
👉 Use Strategy:
·   	EVENTI (corporate): Navy + Gold accents.
·   	Leisure: Emerald/Terracotta + Sand.
·   	Umbrella (Crafted Experiences): Navy base + mix accents as needed.

3. Typography
·   	Headlines: A modern, premium serif (e.g., Playfair Display or Cormorant Garamond).
·   	Body Text: A clean sans serif (e.g., Lato, Montserrat, or Helvetica Neue).
·   	Hierarchy:
o   H1 (Hero) – Serif, Bold, Large.
o   H2/H3 – Serif or Sans, Medium.
o   Body – Sans serif, regular, 16–18px for readability.

4. Imagery & Photography Style
·   	Corporate (EVENTI):
o   Minimalist, clean visuals (venues, elegant gatherings, conferences, executive moments).
o   Focus on atmosphere (lighting, professionalism).
·   	Leisure:
o   Warm, immersive lifestyle images (people exploring, connecting, authentic moments).
o   Focus on emotion, landscapes, details (hands holding a cup of tea in a market, sunset over the sea).
·   	General Guidelines: Avoid stocky or overly posed images. Use high-quality, cinematic photography.

5. Iconography & Graphics
·   	Minimal, line-based icons.
·   	Rounded edges for leisure (softer feel), sharper edges for corporate (professional).
·   	Consistent stroke weight.

6. Website Layout & Feel
·   	Homepage: Clean, modern, with strong whitespace.
·   	Navigation: Split: For Corporates (EVENTI) | For Leisure.
·   	Sectioning: Use color accents to distinguish divisions (corporate vs leisure).
·   	Call-to-Actions: Consistent button styling, but color-coded (e.g., Gold for EVENTI, Green/Terracotta for Leisure).
·   	Typography Scale: Large, bold headlines; clean, readable body text.

7. Tone of Voice (Visual Integration)
·   	Corporate: Minimalist visuals, clear layouts, icons, professional photography.
·   	Leisure: Richer imagery, storytelling through photos, lifestyle design.

8. Applications (Examples)
·   	Business Cards: Minimalist, navy + gold, embossed logo.
·   	Email Signature: Logo + tagline + website, clean layout.
·   	Proposal Decks: EVENTI-branded (Navy/Gold) vs Leisure-branded (Emerald/Terracotta).
·   	Website Mockups: Provide your designer with sample layouts inspired by premium travel/event agencies.

✨ This guideline ensures your brand looks premium and consistent while giving EVENTI and Leisure their own distinct but connected personality.

👉 Would you like me to also prepare a visual moodboard (color palette, typography samples, image styles) that you can literally send to your web designer as a reference sheet?

 
Perfect benchmarks 👌 — I see the common thread: premium, minimal, immersive, high-trust design.
Here’s what I’ll do for you:
1. 	A visual moodboard guide (colors, typography, imagery references).
2. 	A section structure for your site, blending the feel of Abercrombie & Kent / Little Emperors (for leisure) with BCD M&E / CWT (for corporate).

🎨 Visual Moodboard Guide
Color Palette
·   	Corporate / EVENTI
o   Deep Navy (#1C1F36) → trust, authority
o   Elegant Gold (#C7A464) → premium, prestige
o   White / Sand (#F5F3EF) → clean contrast
·   	Leisure / Travel
o   Emerald Green (#0F6B4E) → adventure, nature, authenticity
o   Warm Terracotta (#B55239) → culture, warmth
o   Soft Gray (#E6E6E6) → neutral balance
👉 Use Navy + Gold dominance for corporate sections, Emerald + Terracotta accents for leisure, all unified with white/neutral backgrounds.

Typography
·   	Headlines: Modern serif (luxury, aspirational)
o   Playfair Display, Cormorant Garamond, or Canela (paid option, very high-end).
·   	Body Text: Clean sans serif (clarity, modernity)
o   Lato, Montserrat, or Helvetica Neue.
👉 Use serif for emotional storytelling (hero banners, leisure), sans serif for clarity (corporate pages, service lists).

Imagery Style
·   	Corporate (EVENTI):
o   Minimalist photography, high contrast, sleek venues, professional gatherings.
o   Focus on light, atmosphere, and scale (like BCD M&E).
·   	Leisure:
o   Lifestyle photography: people immersed in moments, landscapes with cinematic tones, cultural textures.

👉 Think Abercrombie & Kent for destination immersion, Little Emperors for luxury exclusivity.

✨ Key Design Principles to Tell Your Web Designer
1. 	Minimalist layout → whitespace, premium typography, clean lines.
2. 	Dual-path UX → homepage clearly separates Corporate (EVENTI) vs Leisure.
3. 	Color-coded accents → EVENTI (navy + gold), Leisure (emerald + terracotta).
4. 	Immersive visuals → big images, cinematic feel, storytelling.
5. 	Strong CTAs → always offer a next step: “Plan an Event” or “Design Your Journey.”

👉 With this structure, you’ll achieve the luxury storytelling of Abercrombie & Kent + the professional clarity of BCD M&E.
Would you like me to now create sample wireframes (layout sketches) for the homepage, corporate page, and leisure page — so your developer has a visual reference for structure?

 
Great 🙌 let’s build sample wireframe structures (in text form, but clear enough to hand over to a designer).
These will show layout hierarchy and user flow for:
Homepage
Corporate (EVENTI) page

Would you like me to also design a unified sitemap (all pages + subpages for SEO & navigation) so your developer has the full structure beyond just the main wireframes?

 
Perfect 🙌 — here’s a unified sitemap that integrates both EVENTI (corporate) and Crafted Experiences (leisure) under one umbrella while keeping navigation clean and SEO-friendly.

🔎 SEO & UX Considerations
Dual-path navigation: “Corporate (EVENTI)” and “Leisure Journeys” clearly separated for clarity.
Case Studies: Positioned as its own hub for credibility → essential for both corporate RFPs and leisure storytelling.
Insights (Blog): Keyword-rich articles → drives organic traffic (e.g., “Top 5 Incentive Travel Destinations 2025” or “Hidden Cultural Gems in Tunisia”).
Destinations Subpages: Each destination gets its own SEO page (like Abercrombie & Kent’s structure).
Service Subpages: Each corporate service gets its own page for keyword targeting (“Corporate Team-Building in Tunisia”).

🧭 Footer Navigation
Quick Links: Home | Corporate (EVENTI) | Leisure Journeys | About Us | Insights | Contact
Legal: Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Cookies Policy
Social Icons: LinkedIn (corporate credibility), Instagram (travel inspiration), YouTube (videos/case studies)

📱 Mobile UX
Keep dual-path clear in hamburger menu.
Add sticky “Plan Your Experience” CTA button (opens a form, user chooses Corporate or Leisure).

👉 With this sitemap, you have clarity for corporate decision-makers and aspiration for leisure travelers — all while maintaining one brand ecosystem.

Would you like me to now map the sitemap into a visual flow diagram (so you can hand it directly to your designer/developer)?

 


Here’s the visual sitemap flow diagram 🗺️ for your brand:
·   	Top-level nodes (Home, Corporate, Leisure, Case Studies, About, Insights, Contact).
·   	Expandable branches show subpages (services, journeys, destinations, etc.).
·   	Clear dual-path flow: EVENTI (corporate) vs. Crafted Experiences (leisure).
You can hand this directly to your designer/developer as a structural blueprint.
👉 Do you also want me to prepare a content outline per page (bullet points of text + visuals to include), so your copywriter/web team knows exactly what goes where?

 
This is excellent — thank you for sharing your story 🙏. You’ve got a founder’s background that screams credibility (luxury hospitality + international exposure + languages) but you’re absolutely right: your brand should highlight the promises and values rather than centering only on your journey.
Let’s do two things:
1. 	Expand your brand promises (values & commitments).
2. 	Content outline per page (so your site flows smoothly and your story is woven in the right places).

🌟 Brand Promises (Positioning Statements)

1. 	Curated Experiences – Every journey and event is carefully designed, with attention to the details that create lasting memories.
2. 	Strong Global Network – Trusted partners worldwide, ensuring seamless execution and insider access.
3. 	Craftsmanship, Character & Connections – The three pillars at the heart of everything we do.
4. 	Local Empowerment – We empower women and men across destinations, enabling them to exceed guest expectations.

✨ Next Step
I suggest we co-write the About Us storytelling section, using your background but framing it around your brand promises (so it doesn’t read as “just your CV,” but as the natural foundation for Crafted Experiences).
Would you like me to draft a story-driven About Us text (≈500 words) that blends your values + your journey into one narrative?

 

🌟 About Us (Draft)
At Crafted Experiences, we believe that every moment has the power to become a story worth telling. Whether it’s a corporate gathering that strengthens teams or a journey that immerses travelers in new cultures, our promise is simple: to design experiences with craftsmanship, character, and meaningful connections.
What We Promise
Curated Experiences – We obsess over the details that transform an itinerary or event into a memory that lasts a lifetime.
Global Network, Local Soul – With trusted partners around the world and empowered local teams, we deliver authentic experiences that go beyond expectations.
Craftsmanship, Character & Connections – The three pillars that define how we work, how we serve, and how we care.
Empowering Communities – We actively support local men and women, enabling them to exceed our guests’ expectations while creating shared value.
Sustainability in Action – From reducing our carbon footprint to choosing responsible materials for events, we design with tomorrow in mind.
Value Over Discounts – We focus on creating unmatched value, rather than competing on price, so our clients always receive more than they imagined.
Excellence, Always – With roots in luxury hospitality, our service anticipates needs before they arise.

Our Story
Hospitality is in our DNA. Our founder was literally born in a hotel, and from an early age, life has been a journey across cultures and cities — from Tunis and Cairo to Berlin, London, Paris, Milan, Lugano, Geneva, and Lausanne. This international upbringing instilled a deep respect for diversity, detail, and the art of meaningful connections.
After earning a Bachelor’s in Marketing & International Business, followed by a Master’s in Economics and Communication with a major in International Tourism, our founder honed his craft in Switzerland — first at the iconic Beau-Rivage Palace Lausanne, mastering service excellence, and then at the Four Seasons Hotel Tunis, where he led catering and sales for corporate and leisure markets across the globe. Managing strategic accounts, luxury partnerships, and diverse international markets provided an insider view of what makes experiences truly exceptional.
In 2021, after repeated requests from clients seeking personalized travel and event solutions, the first chapter of this agency was born under the name TravCraft. From organizing the launch of the Porsche Taycan in Tunisia to designing unforgettable journeys for private clients, the vision quickly grew. Today, that vision has evolved into Crafted Experiences for leisure journeys and EVENTI for corporate travel and events.

Why Crafted Experiences?
We are not just planners or coordinators. We are curators, storytellers, and connectors. We design with care, drawing on a global network and a spirit of craftsmanship that ensures no detail is left to chance. Our guests and clients trust us because we make the complex feel seamless, the ordinary feel extraordinary, and every moment feel intentional.
At Crafted Experiences and EVENTI, your story is our craft.

👉 This strikes a balance between values + your founder credibility without sounding like a CV.
Would you like me to also shorten this into a 100–150 word “About Us summary” for use on your homepage and proposals (a more concise version)?
